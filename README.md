# accordionCSS
Animated + responsive accordion made exclusively with css (no javascript click events!)


hey! this is a project i made to highlight just how much can be done with css alone, using the :target pseudo element makes it possible to animate, remove and add elements through click events.

feel free to use any components in your own work :)
